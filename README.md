# surfs_up
A project based on SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build on our knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. Python code in a Jupyter notebook and create graphs using Python.
Background
We are doing weather analysis to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round on the islands of Hawaii.

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June (40 points)
Deliverable 1 Instructions
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

In Step 1, write a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June.
In Step 2, convert the June temperatures to a list.
In Step 3, create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for the month of June.
In Step 4, generate the summary statistics for the June temperatures DataFrame.

Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December (40 points)
Deliverable 2 Instructions
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

In Step 6, write a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December.
In Step 7, convert the December temperatures to a list.
In Step 8, create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for the month of December.
In Step 9, generate the summary statistics for the December temperatures DataFrame.

Deliverable 3 Instructions
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Deliverable 3 Requirements
Structure, Organization, and Formatting (6 points)
The written analysis has the following structure, organization, and formatting:

There is a title, and there are multiple sections. (2 pt)
Each section has a heading and subheading. (2 pt)
Links to images are working and displayed correctly. (2 pt)
Analysis (14 points)
The written analysis has the following:

Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)
Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
Submission
Once you’re ready to submit, make sure to check your work against the rubric to ensure you are meeting the requirements for this Challenge one final time. It’s easy to overlook items when you’re in the zone!
